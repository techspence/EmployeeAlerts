# EmployeeAlerts
A series of scripts used to monitor employee Active Directory accounts and send alerts about important events or information.

**HiredTerminatedAlerts.ps1** - A PowerShell script that searches Active Directory for newly created and newly disabled user accounts (e.g. new employees/terminated employees) then sends a slack/email notification.

2. Launch powershell as the user that will run this script
4. Naviage to the folder you placed the script into
4. Create a secure token file by running `.\CreateTokenFile.ps1`
5. Copy and paste your **Bot User OAuth Access Token** which was obtained from step 5 in the previous section
    - Your token is now saved in a secure file called `token.txt`
    - *Note: OAuth Access tokens are secrets and should be treated as such*

2. Click on your desired channel
3. The series of numbers and letters at the end of the URL after the `/` is the channel ID

## Secure File Note
- In order to run this script as a task you must first create a secure token file using the same account that's going to run the script.
    
    - To create a secure token file, use `CreateTokenFile.ps1`
    
    - This means you can’t just copy the ‘secure token file’ to other machines and reuse it, nor access it from an account that did not create the secure file.
    
    - Also, in order for DAPI (& this script) to work, the GPO setting Network Access: Do not allow storage of passwords and credentials for network authentication 
        must be set to Disabled (or not configured).  Otherwise the encryption key will only last for the lifetime of the user session (i.e. upon user logoff or a 
        machine reboot, the key is lost and it cannot decrypt the secure string text)


## Planned Features
- **Alert When Specific Employee Information is Missing**
This script would look for specific employee information in Active Directory and sends an alert when said information has been found.

- **Schedule a Welcome Email to All Employees**
I have code pre-built that can be used to schedule an email to be sent once a new employee is found. It has not been tested yet.
